<h1>Assignment 1: My Profile</h1>
<h3>Personal information</h3>

My name is Mark Kovach, my student number is s3898475 and my student email is s3898475@student.rmit.edu.au.<br> 
I was born in Australia and live in the western suburbs. I am the youngest of 2 brothers with my oldest brother having a baby girl. My nationality is Croatian, and my last name translated into English is “Blacksmith”. I am a first-year student at RMIT studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I decided to study at RMIT mainly because I have an interest in technology and IT, and wish to learn more about it, so studying at a university that is named for its involvement in technology and things about it was a no brainer for me. Also, an upside would be that it is easy for me to get to. Some hobbies I have are to play and watch soccer (football). I started playing soccer when I was around 6-9. I now play as a defender at Spring Hills Soccer Club. Another hobby I have are to play the guitar and sing. I have been playing the guitar for around 5 years now and have just recently tried to sing along while playing. Other hobbies I have are to watch tv shows, anime and play video games. Some of my favorite tv shows and anime are Avatar the Last Airbender, How I Met Your Mother, Your Lie in April, Hunter x Hunter and Full-metal Alchemist Brotherhood. Some games that I enjoy are CSGO, Undertale, binding of Isaac Rebirth, Spelunky and Pokémon.

<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p>
My interest in IT began when I started to use computers and playing games on them. I wondered how they got the computer to display games that work. I wanted to learn what goes into the computer and how the software makes the computer run, so I started to mess around with batch files and the command prompt to get the computer to do simple things like opening a notepad or a webpage and getting it to input key characters. I also interested in how Wi-Fi connections work and why streaming speeds differ sometimes. Getting the computer to understand what I wanted it to do through command prompt and batch files intrigued me to learn more on how to control the computer. I choose to come to RMIT because I thought that it could help me broaden my understanding of how computers work and the technology around them, and so I could my field of work can be around technology and computers. I expected to learn the fundamentals of coding and learn the handling and storing of data. I also expected to learn about how to keep your html code and programing code safe from breaking as to not allow others from imputing code to the website or code, as well as other cyber security defenses like how to stop a DDOS attack.

<p>
The position is someone that reports to the head of testing about penetration testing for global brands. They work to help find security gaps in websites, networks mobile applications and other security appliances by trying different techniques like SQL injections and MITM attacks. The skills qualifications and experience need for this job is an experience of 2-3 of penetration testing, being able to communicate well with others, proven record of pervious penetration testing you have completed, having the knowledge and practical skills of assessing web application vulnerabilities using XSS, SQL injections and CSRF. Hands on experiences with different tools to help like Burpsuite, Nikto, Nmap, SQLmap, Metasploit, ExploitDB and Dirbuster. The skills that I currently have for the job is little knowledge of SQL injections and XSS, and zero experiences in performing a penetration test and using the different tools. My plans to obtain the skills and requirements for this job are to complete my study of Bachelor of Information Technology and then maybe if required take a course in Cyber Security.

The results of the of each test was not very surprising for me, as for the learning style test, I find it much easier to learn things if someone shows me how it is done and uses examples rather than someone explaining to me how something is done.<br>
<br>
The results in these tests should not affect the way I behave while working in a team. While working in a team I like to participate or contribute as much as anyone else, carrying my weight and not having to let others do my work because I am unable to complete it.<br>
<br>
While forming a team I would like to look for people that are willing to put in effort and carry their own weight themselves as I do not like having to do extra work because someone else is slacking. I find that it is fair if everyone participates equally. 
</p>
<h3>Project idea</h3>
<p>
The project idea that I have come up with is an automatic DJ and song mixer. It will be an application that plays music in a way that always keeps the beat going by mixing together a list of songs that the user puts in so that the music does not stop and start when a new song is played and instead is a smooth transition from one song to the other. From the list of songs that the user puts into the playlist, the application will try to find the best chemistry of the song that is playing with another song in the playlist and transition from one to the other.<br>
<br>
I believe that this project idea will interesting and useful because the application will act like their own personal DJ allowing the users to make their own playlist and have it make a mashup of their songs. This would allow them to bring it to a house party and not have to hire a professional or someone they know to be the DJ or just having the music stop and start each time a new song came on. It would be quick and easy allowing for them to just enjoy the party.<br>
<br>
The features of the application are to be like a normal everyday music player that can hold playlist that the user makes like Spotify, SoundCloud or YouTube, however the difference is that there will be additional features to make the songs in the playlist transition from one to the other smoothly, without stopping the music. It will have different settings to choose from being just a simple transition to a more complex transition. The simple transition will be a small fade in fade out transition where the current song playing starts to fade out nearing the end of the song and the next song coming up starts to fade in as the other song fades out. This setting is useful for mixing different types of music genre as the application just fades in one song for the other to keep the music going. This will be useful for a majority of people as they do not need the complex transitions and just wish for the music to be continuous. The other complex setting is meant to mimic what a real professional DJ would do in the way it transitions different songs with complexity. This includes slightly increasing or decreasing the tempo and BPM of the song on queue to be played next and synching up the beats so that the song playing next does not seem forced and the consistent beat is continued, trying to find an optimum place in the song for the transition to occur, not just at the end of the song. Other features include a BPM and genre detector which will help people create playlist that will give smoother transitions between songs while using the more complex settings. Another feature is a recommendation of other songs with the same or similar BPM and genre to songs in a playlist.<br>
<br>
The tools and software that I will need to make this project will be a software that will help me in making a compute or phone-based application. Some open-sourced tools that I will be using are a bpm detector and genre detector.<br>
<br>
The skill required to make this project is knowledge in programing an application, and writing the code need for the application to figure out how to transition from one song to the other using both simply and complex methods. This knowledge can be from a range of programing codes like python C++ and more. It will be difficult to find the skills to make a program that acts like a professional DJ<br>
<br>
If the project is completed, the outcome will be an application that is used when playing a playlist of songs and wanting the songs to transition smoothly and keep the music without stopping and starting a new song. Its original goal of being a stand in DJ for house parties will have been achieved as it will be an application on a smartphone or computer. The impact of this development will be that there would not be a need to hire mediocre DJs for small events or parties, instead using the application will be enough.
